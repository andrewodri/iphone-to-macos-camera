When you are using an iOS device as a camera, and additionally want to share anothert iOS devices screen, Zoom will automatically choose which device screen is shared. In my experience, this is always the iPhone, and that invariably breaks the connection with the camera software, and you're worse of off then when you started.

If you want to share your iPad's screen _and_ audio, then this may be an acceptable solution.

## On your iPad...

1. Enable Airplane mode, turn off Wi-fi, and turn off notifications _(This is so that you don't get notifications popping up while screen sharing, and don't have any unexpected updates downloading in the background choking up your connection.)_
2. Connect your iPad to your Mac via USB

_**Tip:** New versions of iOS have mouse support. If you would like to set your iPad aside and control it via the Quicktime preview window, you may find pairing an extra mouse with the iPad is a good solution._

## On your Mac...

1. Open System Preferences, select Sharing, and check Internet Sharing
2. On the Internet Sharing options screen, select the device that supplies your internet for "Share your connection from", and select your "[iPad name] USB" from "To computers using"

Even though your iPad is in Airplane mode with Wi-fi disabled, applications will still be able to connect to the internet (and your local network) via internet connection sharing over USB.

The next steps take place once your Zoom meeting is established, and you wish to share your iPad's screen:

1. Click on the Share Screen button from the meeting window
2. Check thre "Share computer sound" checkbox, and then select iPhone/iPad via AirPlay
3. On your iPad, open the control center, and select Screen Mirroring
4. Select the "Zoom-[Mac name]" target

You iPad screen and audio will now be shared within the meeting.
